# Capstone Project Proposal

IDEA 1: Movie review differences
Difference between movie rating websites - compare differences in scores between Rotten Tomatoes & IMDB, and maybe add Metacritic and/or Fandango.

Identify trends in movies with greatest delta - box office vs rating difference, cross reference with oscars/awards list 

Possible clients: streaming services like Netflix or its competitors who are looking to expand their libraries with movies that are undervalued but will be liked by customers. (Think: Moneyball for streaming).
Personal interest: my brother and I often debate which movie rating sites are more reliable (based on our personal tastes) for movies where there is a large difference between the scores. I tend to agree more with RT, he likes IMDB. I’m interested in identifying other movies which have large score differences to test our movie review site preferences. 

Data: Top 100?1000?5000?10000? Past 5 years? Should be able to pull stuff off Kaggle.

##What is the problem you want to solve?
I want to investigate the delta in movie review scores across multiple review websites: IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes (RT), and Metacritic (MC). Even with something as subjective as an opinion of a movie, one would expect to see a high degree of correlation between the aforementioned sites, which is often not the case. I've personally noticed many movies which have wildly different scores across the various sites, which may be in part to opinion biases in professional movie critics vs the general audience, the demographics of a particular website's average reviewer, or the rating system of each site.  Independently, the distributions for each of the review websites are quite unique to each site, as visualized [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19).

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
